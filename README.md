# -extract_analyze_data-
Designed and analyzed a multi-table ecommerce dataset using MySQL. Created 5 normalized tables and imported 3 CSVs. Demonstrated SQL skills with SELECT, JOINs, subqueries, aggregates, views, and indexing. Delivered insights through query outputs and screenshots.


🛒 Ecommerce SQL Analysis – Task 4

📌 Project Overview
This project showcases my ability to design, structure, and analyze a multi-table ecommerce dataset using MySQL. I created five normalized tables (customers, orders, orderitems, products, payments) and imported real data from CSV files to run meaningful queries and extract business insights.

🧱 Database Design
• 	Defined clean table schemas with appropriate data types (VARCHAR, INT, DECIMAL,DATETIME)
• 	Ensured relational integrity through consistent keys and joinable fields
• 	Imported 3 core tables (customers, orders, products ) for analysis

🔍 SQL Capabilities Demonstrated
• 	SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY  for filtering and aggregation
• 	INNER, LEFT, RIGHT JOIN to combine customer, order, and product data
• 	Subqueries to isolate specific customer behaviors
• 	Aggregate functions like SUM, AVG for performance metrics
• 	Views created for reusable insights (e.g., state-wise order summary)
• 	Indexes added to optimize query speed on key columns

📊 Sample Insights
• 	Top cities by order volume
• 	Monthly order trends
• 	Average order approval time by state
• 	Product category distribution

📸 Deliverables
• 	SQL queries with screenshots of results
• 	Table definitions and import confirmation
• 	README summary

🚀 Tools Used
• 	MySQL Workbench
• 	CSV import wizard
• 	Snipping Tool for screenshots
